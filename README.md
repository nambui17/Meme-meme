  ## Usage

  Type lines of code just like any other IDE. Text will be highlighted for variables. The webpage will save to the contents of what you type in the local storage and saves it an Indexed Database so your data gets saved upon reload of the page.

  Type text into any of the lines of code to begin. When you navigate away from the page, the text editor will save your progress and keep it for you for later use.
